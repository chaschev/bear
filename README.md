# Welcome the Bear!

Bear is a lightweight framework and a deployment tool for Java. It's main goal is to make your deployment a programming task by using OOP, static types and fluent programming techniques which one find in many modern languages and libraries. Bear first started as a Capistrano clone, but then grew into a different project.

Bear is in it's early development stages now. Questions, concerns? Just drop me a line at chaschev@gmail.com.

### Bear Highlights

* Syntax completion in IDEs, static type safety and OOP approach (see demos below)
* Dynamic scripting with Groovy (@CompileStatic for strict Java-like mode)
* Debugging in IDEs and script unit-testing
* Fast, parallel execution framework
* Desktop UI app to monitor running tasks (Twitter Bootstrap 3)
* A single project definition file driven by annotations and convention over configuration
* Scripts can be edited in UI and in IDEs (by importing through Maven)
* Lambda-based configuration, session/global evaluation context for variables
* (planned) JavaScript, Ruby and Python support
* Takes some of the ideas from Capistrano

### Project Samples

Each deployment project consists of basically these parts:

* Plugins configuration. `BearProject::configureMe` - i.e. add NodeJs or Play! framework plugin, bind project source root to VCS folder, etc.
* Adding tasks. Tasks are pieces of deployments which can be reused, i.e. 'run Ant task (Java)' or 'run Grunt task (JS)' or 'run rake (Ruby)'.
* Defining scripts. Scripts are collections of tasks which are most commonly used, i.e. setup script, deploy script db dump or restore script. The goal is to run each scenario with minimal action.

Deployment project examples are available under the [examples folder][examplesFolder].

* [node-express-mongoose-demo deployment][NodeExpressMongooseDemoProject] Stack: Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
* [Secure Social deployment][SecureSocialDemoProject] Stack: Java, Play! Framework 2, MySQL/MongoDB, Secure Social.
* [Shell API basic usage][BasicExamplesDemoProject]

Bear uses a computing grid framework under the hood which is invisible to the user by default. If you at some moment would require to utilize any of it's features to coordinate hosts session, i.e. to speed up a big file download by downloading it on a single host and sharing it among others, you could manually access the Grid API.

Computing Grid is an execution table for the tasks. It is a parallel framework which allows syncing tasks execution, communicating, sharing their results. Any task is run inside a grid and can be synchronized by getting a Future for some other cell in a grid.

### Installing and using Bear (latest developer release)

Bear is designed to be used as a normal Java library. A possible way to run it's projects is to have it on classpath and do `new YourBearProject().deploy()`.

To install the latest stage version of Bear, type in your console:

    mvn com.chaschev:installation-maven-plugin:1.4:install -Dartifact=com.chaschev:bear -Dshapshots=true -U

This command requires Maven 3.1.1+ installed and also might require administrator rights to create shortcuts in JAVA_HOME.

Note: installation-maven-plugin might not yet be in Maven Central at the time of writing.

To create a new Bear project after installation type

    bear --create project-name

This will create a .bear folder in which there will be a `pom.xml` and a simple project definition. In `.bear/project-name.properties` configuration can be defined, i.e. SSH authentication data. `.bear/pom.xml` project can be imported as a Maven module to an IDE of your choice and after it `.bear/ProjectNameProject.groovy` is ready to be run.

### Building Bear

Bear requires Maven 3.x to build:

    git clone https://github.com/chaschev/bear.git
    cd bear
    mvn com.zenjava:javafx-maven-plugin:2.0:fix-classpath
    mvn install

Third command will fix JavaFX installation to be available on classpath. You might need to run this with admin user. [More...](http://zenjava.com/javafx/maven/fix-classpath.html)

### Bear UI

Bear has a UI written in AngularJS inside a JavaFX's WebView. It's probably the first AngularJS desktop app. :-) It has  a code editor with code completion for script editing and many panes and triggers to monitor deployment execution over your hosts.
