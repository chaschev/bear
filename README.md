# Welcome the Bear!

Bear is a lightweight framework deployment tool for Java. It's main goal is to make your deployment a programming task by using OOP, static types and fluent programming techniques which one find in many modern languages and libraries. Bear first started as a Capistrano clone, but then grew into a different project.

Bear is in it's early development stages now. Questions, concerns? Just drop me a line at chaschev@gmail.com.

### Bear Highlights

* Syntax completion in IDEs, static type safety and OOP approach (see demos below)
* Dynamic scripting with Groovy (@CompileStatic for strict Java-like mode)
* Debugging in IDEs and script unit-testing
* Fast execution, parallel execution framework
* Desktop UI app to monitor running tasks (Twitter Bootstrap 3)
* A single project definition file driven by annotations and convention over configuration
* Scripts can be edited in UI and in IDEs (by importing through Maven)
* Lambda-based configuration, session/global evaluation context for variables
* (planned) JavaScript, Ruby and Python support
* Takes some of the ideas from Capistrano

### Project Samples

Each deployment project consists of basically these parts:

* Plugins configuration. `BearProject::configureMe` - i.e. add NodeJs or Play! framework plugin, bind project source root to VCS folder, etc.
* Adding tasks. Tasks are pieces of deployments which can be reused, i.e. 'run Ant task (Java)' or 'run Grunt task (JS)' or 'run rake (Ruby)'.
* Defining scripts. Scripts are collections of tasks which are most commonly used, i.e. setup script, deploy script db dump or restore script. The goal is to run each scenario with minimal action.

Deployment project examples are available under the [examples folder][examplesFolder].

* [node-express-mongoose-demo deployment][NodeExpressMongooseDemoProject] Stack: Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
* [Secure Social deployment][SecureSocialDemoProject] Stack: Java, Play! Framework 2, MySQL/MongoDB, Secure Social.
* [Shell API basic usage][BasicExamplesDemoProject]

Bear uses a ... framework under the hood which invisible to the user. If you want to ... i.e. speed up download ... you can access Grid API via ...

There are also grids. Grid is an execution table for the tasks. It is a parallel framework which allows syncing tasks execution, communicating, sharing their results (i.e. a file downloaded). Any task is run inside a grid and can be synchronized by getting a Future for some other cell in a grid. If your tasks a simple and you don't need syncing, grid cold be seen as an array for your tasks.


### Bear UI

Bear has a UI written in AngularJS inside a JavaFX's WebView. It's probably the first AngularJS desktop app. :-) It has  a code editor with code completion for script editing and many panes and triggers to monitor deployment execution over your hosts.
