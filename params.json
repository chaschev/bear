{"name":"Bear","tagline":"Remote Automation with Groovy and JVM Friends","body":"# Welcome the Bear!\r\n\r\nBear is a lightweight remote automation tool for Java. Bear differs from other existing deployment tools by using OOP, static types and fluent programming techniques. It first started as a Capistrano clone, but then grew into a different project.\r\n\r\nFirst version of Bear has been released on January 12th, 2014 and is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nTo quickly start using the Bear, check out the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/chaschev/bear/wiki/1.1.1.-Demo.-List-a-remote-dir).\r\n\r\nYou may find an interesting topic to read in our [Wiki](https://github.com/chaschev/bear/wiki).\r\n\r\nBear has [demos and examples](https://github.com/chaschev/bear/wiki/1.1.3.-Node.js%2C-Grails%2C-Tomcat%2C-Play-and-other-demos) to use as prototypes for your own projects. These demos are also used as integration tests. At the moment Bear supports Node.js, Grails, Play! Framework.\r\n\r\nOur main priorities for the project for now are usability and bugfixing, so your feedback, bugreports and feature requests are very welcome. You can [create a ticket or ask a question](https://github.com/chaschev/bear/issues) or just drop a line at chaschev@gmail.com. We will accept contributions - below you will find instructions on how to build Bear and how to start the integration tests. Please discuss your changes with us if you want to change or add something significant.\r\n\r\n### Bear Highlights\r\n\r\n* Syntax completion in IDEs, static type safety and OOP approach (see demos below)\r\n* Dynamic scripting with Groovy (@CompileStatic for strict Java-like mode)\r\n* Debugging in IDEs and (planned) script unit-testing\r\n* Fast, parallel execution framework\r\n* Desktop UI app to monitor running tasks (Twitter Bootstrap 3)\r\n* A single project definition file driven by annotations and convention over configuration\r\n* Scripts can be edited in UI and in IDEs (by importing through Maven)\r\n* Configuration is driven by variables any of which can be redefined globally or for a single host.\r\n* Technologies supported: Node.js, Grails, Play! Framework 2, Tomcat, upstart scripts.\r\n* (planned) JavaScript, Ruby and Python support\r\n* Takes some of the ideas from Capistrano\r\n\r\n### Bear UI\r\n\r\nBear has a UI written in AngularJS inside a JavaFX's WebView. It's probably the first AngularJS desktop app. :-)\r\n\r\n![Configuration Sample][uiLs]\r\n\r\n[uiLs]: https://raw.github.com/chaschev/bear/master/doc/img/bear-ui-ls.png\r\n\r\n### Installing and using Bear\r\n\r\nTo install the latest stage version of Bear, type in your console:\r\n\r\n    mvn com.chaschev:installation-maven-plugin:1.4:install -Dartifact=com.chaschev:bear\r\n\r\nThere is [more on this in Wiki](https://github.com/chaschev/bear/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Building Bear\r\n\r\nBear requires Maven 3.x to build:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/chaschev/bear.git\r\n    cd bear\r\n    mvn com.zenjava:javafx-maven-plugin:2.0:fix-classpath\r\n    mvn install\r\n\r\nThird command will fix JavaFX installation to be available on classpath. You might need to run this with admin user.
